#This markdown file is just a starter for the project where things are not organized, as all the rough analysis and data filtration things will happen over here.

#At first we will import all the dataset present at the "dataset" folder.

#After importing the data we would filter it accordingly

#We will use simple data visualization techniques to view the complex data models

#Our entire thoughts on this analysis are put into picture with the help of an web application or shiny application

#On doing this we would be able to identify the presence of a relation (if any) and also demonstrate our course learning objectives.
